About me
I am an assistant professor in the Department of Mathematics, at the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam. I work on problems and solutions in machine learning and statistics. My research focuses on sequential learning, and in particular on (sequential) hypothesis testing, Bayesian learning and best-arm identification problems. Central in my work is both bringing a solid mathematical foundation to the topics I work on in different fields, as well as making the theory accessible for less mathematical audiences. I’m also interested in the mathematical and philosophical foundations of Bayesianism, machine learning, statistics and probability theory.

Veni grant
I am very happy that NWO (the Dutch Research Council) awarded my proposal “E-values for multiple testing” a Veni grant of 280.000 euros. With this I can conduct my own research for the coming 3 years.

Cor Baayen Award
I was awarded the 2023 Cor Baayen Early Career Researcher Award (news article). Since I was on pregnancy/maternity leave in the last months of 2023, I will probably receive it and give a talk about my work in the ERCIM spring meeting in 2024.
News
	•	In September I will move to the University of Twente.
	•	Our paper on GROW-optimal group-invariant statistics (arxiv) is accepted to the Annals of Statistics.
	•	May 5-9: I had a fantastic week with fellow e-value enthusiasts in Oberwolfach.
	•	April 26: Together with Jelle Goeman we submitted a grant proposal (M2) to NWO.
	•	There were several interviews with me the last months in (national) newspapers and magazines: NAW (PDF), NRC (PDF, Link), The New Scientist (Picture), and Ad Valvas (Link).
