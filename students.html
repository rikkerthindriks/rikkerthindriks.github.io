<h2>Prospective BSc and MSc thesis projects</h2>
<p>If you are interested in doing a thesis project with me for your BSc or MSc in mathematics, or a related discipline with a strong mathematical component, feel free to drop me an e-mail stating your interests (if they overlap with mine).</p>
<p>For the Spring semester 2024 I'm completely full unfortunately.</p>
<h2>Prospective PhD students</h2>
<p>At the moment I do not have funding for a new PhD position. I may have in the near future - I will keep this web page updated.</p>
<p>If you are interested in doing a PhD with me and you bring your own funding or you are planning to apply for a grant to do so, feel free to contact me, and if I also think it's a good match I can help you with it. It helps to decribe in your e-mail why you think my research interests fit well with yours, and why you think it is a good idea for me to consider you. I don't respond to generic e-mails.</p>
<h2>Prospective postdocs</h2>
<p>At the moment I do not have funding for a postdoc position.</p>
<p>If you are interested in doing a postdoc with me, there are many <a href="https://asntech.github.io/postdoc-funding-schemes/">funding schemes</a> available to obtain your own funding. Contact me if you consider this, and I can help you with the application.</p>
